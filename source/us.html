<p>During his inauguration address on Friday, Donald Trump released an image that had nothing to do with crowd size or marchers: his official White House portrait.
<br>
<br>
The picture, which features prominently in the White House website’s biography of Trump, depicts the president in front of what appears to be a green-screen image of the White House. In his characteristic red tie, Trump leans forward, no smile, with an aggressive — arguably menacing — stare.

The image struck us as unusual, so we reached out to some professional photographers and presidential scholars to help us unpack why. The photo is odd, they agreed, especially when compared with past presidents’ photos.</p>

<p>According to Cara Finnegan, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who’s writing a book about presidential photography, White House portraits share a number of common elements that place them within a distinct photographic genre. There’s the representation of the American flag, a symbol present in nearly every official portrait since Nixon’s. And there’s the head-and-shoulders shot of the suit-clad man, meant to communicate a sense of authority and confidence.</p>
